As we have described above, We have various parts like the index page, admin page, teacher page, student page. I have mainly focused on the front end and database.
So, when we will run the project, we will see the "Take Admission" on the index page. Here, we can Sign in or Create new loign to take the attandance in the school. As we go further, we will see admin page where he/she can login and has access to everything. Admin can manage teacher's, student's, attandance section respectively. Furthermore, In teacher's section, we will get all the information related to teacher. For eg. Adding new teachers, Edit existing teacher details, Teacher's salary, Any pending request of the teacher. Whereas in Student section, We will see Number of students, Add new student, Edit existing student details, Student fees pending and attandance.
